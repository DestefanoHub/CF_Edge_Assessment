Please note to following in regards to the tasks:

1. I ran the tasks via CommandBox's local server as well as a local version of CF2023 that I have installed.

2. I encountered difficulty when attempting to access the database via MS SQL Server. I believe it was an issue with assigning
a user to the database after importing it. I used a MySQL database instead. I only ran the database tasks in CF2023 as I had
the datasource defined in the CF administrator.

3. MySQL didn't seem to like the table name 'order', so it is named 'orders' in my code. Please be aware of this before running
the code.

4. I commented out the entire section of the application.cfc pertaining to the database configuration. Please be aware of this 
before running the code.

5. In any of the tasks that required modifying existing material (I believe only tasks 9 and 10), I commented near each change
and indicated what was done, starting with <!---CHANGE .

6. I used a combination of "older" and "newer" approaches. If chosen, I am completely fine with whatever the team's style
may be.
